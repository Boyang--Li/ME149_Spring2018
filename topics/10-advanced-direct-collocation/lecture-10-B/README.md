# Lecture 10-B

## Project Proposals:
- Meetings today!
- Proposals turned in via Trunk next week

## Homework
- HW 08 grades are posted
  - fast grading - look at solutions if you struggled with the assignment
- HW 09 - Due yesterday!
  - submit it soon if you have not done so already!
- HW 10 - half posted
  - same as HW 09, but using Hermite--Simpson direct collocation
  - formal assignment document posted today or tomorrow.
    - code will not change
  - due late next week

## Today:
- Hermite--Simpson Direct Collocation!
- Review of error analysis

## Hermite--Simpson Direct Collocation
- quadratic dynamics and Control
- cubic state

## Separated vs Compressed Hermite--Simpson

## Open questions:
- review any topic in particular?

## Non-smooth solutions

## Working with path constraints

## Dealing with difficult optimization problems

## Jacobian Sparsity
- Runge--Kutta methods - intermediate variable constraints

## Remeshing

## Multi-phase trajectory optimization

## Path constraints
